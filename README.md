# Note
Kasey Ozymy created this game, and I don't own anything related to it. I did this program because it seemed interesting to me and also because I want to improve my skills in Python with PyGame. I hope you understand! Speaking of so, you should play it! [Click here to go the Steam page!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/706560/Jimmy_and_the_Pulsating_Mass/)

Enjoy!
